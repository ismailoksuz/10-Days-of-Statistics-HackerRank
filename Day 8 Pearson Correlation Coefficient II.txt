Problem:
The regression line of y on x is 3x+4y+8=0, and the regression line of x on y is 4x+3y+7=0. 
What is the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

Solution:

3x + 4y + 8 = 0
4y = -3x - 8
y = (-3x - 8)/4 = (-3/4)x - 2
slope = -3/4 

4x + 3y + 7 = 0
4x = -3y - 7
x = (-3/4)y - 7/4
slope = -3/4

slope1 * slope2 = r^2
-3/4 * -3/4 = 9/16
|r| = 3/4

Since both slopes are negative, sign is negative.
Hence the answer is -3/4.
